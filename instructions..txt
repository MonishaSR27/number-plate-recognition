1. The user uploads an image to a specified Amazon S3 bucket.

2. Once the image is uploaded, an S3 event triggers an AWS lambda function.

3. The lambda function sends the image data to Amazon Rekognition using the detect_text Api to extract text from the image.

4. Lambda reads the image directly from S3 using the bucket name.

5. Rekognition performs OCR(Optical Character Recognition) on the image and returns the detected text.

6. Lambda prepares the extracted plate number and image metadata for storage.

7. The recognized number plate along with the image name or timestamp is stored in a DynamoDB table for future lookup, logging or enforcement actions.
